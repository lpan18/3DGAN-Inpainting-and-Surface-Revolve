# Generative Inpainting + 3D GAN + Surface Revolve
---
### Generative Inpainting   
Use the [Semantic Image Inpainting with Deep Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07539) to inpaint image.     
 
### 3D Generative Adversarial Networks     
Based on Minst dataset, use voxels as 3D GAN input

### Surface Revolve    
Revolve bezier curve to form a 3D surface. Blender Script version and Matlab version.
